# Signature-Forgery-Detection-with-Forger-Detection-Using-CNN
## Project Description
A signature can be defined as a unique mark which is a handwritten representation an individual creates in order to authenticate any written records. When an individual signs a document it means that the individual is giving their consent, approval and agreement after studying the whole document when he/she is mentally sound.
Now a days signatures are loosing their authenticity due to the rise of forgery. Signature forgery is a process that involves the unauthorized imitation of an individual's signature in order to deceive others into believing it is genuine.

As the title suggests this project is about signature forgery detection along with an add-on of who might have done the forgery.
